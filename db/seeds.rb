There is something for everyone to enjoy from walks through its wide open spaces, to boating on the Serpentine Lake, to horse riding, a game of tennis or a chance to swim in the lake. Kensington Gardens adjoins Hyde Park and here you find Kensington Palace where Prince William and Kate live with Prince George. (Although you can visit the palace I'm afraid you are unlikely to spot these royals!) There are two free art galleries as well as the Princess Diana Memorial Playgrounds and Fountain for children and the statue of Peter Pan. Hyde Park is the location for many great open air concerts, as well as the famous Speakers’ Corner where anyone can speak their piece. There’s plenty of space to play ball games or you can just lie down, have a picnic and rest from the busy task of visiting London.",

      Located by the side of the river, the building stands out for its unique design (as you can see in any of the pictures) but also because of its colors and textures. If you are visiting it, I recommend you walk on one of the streets following the river towards the church. That way you'll enjoy the river and all the little shops, artisans and musicians along the way.
      You must not miss this place if you are in St Petersburg.

After you've admired it up close, walk further on Champ de Mars and pause for a drink in the grass (on summer nights) or a romantic walk (on winter nights).",
